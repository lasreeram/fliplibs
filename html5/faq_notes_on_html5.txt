- New CSS features (CSS3)

- No more need to support cookies - use browser local storage instead

Q. Is javascript object oriented?
Yes. javascript uses prototypes instead of classes for inhertence. It is possible to simulate many class based features using prototypes in javascript.

var foo = {name: "foo", one: 1, two: 2};
var bar = {two: "two", three: 3};

Object.setPrototypeOf(bar, foo);
bar.one // Resolves to 1.
bar.three // Resolves to 3.
// Own properties shadow prototype properties
bar.two; // Resolves to "two"
bar.name; // unaffected, resolves to "foo"
foo.name; // Resolves to "foo"


Q. In javascript what is the difference between undefined and null?
Undefined and null are two different values. Undefined means a variable hasn't been assigned a value; null means a variable has no value.

Q. In javascript, html what is the difference between property and attribute?

	- Some HTML attributes have 1:1 mapping onto properties. id is one example of such.
	- Some do not (e.g. the value attribute specifies the initial value of an input, but the value property specifies the current value).


Q. In javascript how do you differentiate local and global variables?
variables declared with "var" are local and without "var" are global.

Q. What are the different geo-location methods?
IP Address based - Browsers use a map of IP address to location, can some times resolve only to the ISPs location.
GPS based - uses satelites to locate, only on smart phones, hard on batteries, require the sky to be clear/visible
Cell phone triangulation - using distance from one or more cell phone towers, more the towers better the accuracy
wifi positioning - wifi access points to triangulate your loctaion, for example in a coffee house
